<p>A project to create charging infrastructure in Russia and other countries from the team of Portal Energy, a manufacturer of charging stations. </p>

<p>The main idea of the project is that we want to build not just a business, but also involve the community in the process of creating and managing this business. That is, we want to make it decentralized. </p>
<h2>How does it all work. </h2>

<p>The technical component of the project is simple - we install stations in special places and sell electricity to owners of electric vehicles.</p>
<p>In order for the project to be developed in a decentralized manner, we need tools to control the addition of value to the project and reward the adder. For example, if someone has found a suitable location to install a station and is willing to contribute it to the project, they are adding value to the project. Our task is to check whether the place meets the criteria and reward the person according to his contribution. </p>
<p>We use the POE token to express value within the project. Holding a token becomes a co-owner of the charging network and a member of the community. </p>
<p>The emission of a token is tied to adding value, accordingly it can be mined by performing work on the development of the project, and the token is issued when a new station appears on the network, ready for work.</p>
<p>The profit that charging stations bring is distributed using staking. </p>
<p>You can get POE in two ways. Buy on the exchange and mine, doing useful work for the development of the project. </p>
<p>We highlight three areas of useful work:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Community development tasks</li>
     <li>Development tasks</li>
     <li>Network development tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>All tasks are divided by difficulty levels. As the level increases, tasks will appear that require specific knowledge and skills to complete, but the rewards for completing them will be appropriate.</p>
