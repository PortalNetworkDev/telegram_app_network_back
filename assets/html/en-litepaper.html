<h3>Electric Vehicles Charging Infrastructure Development Project</h3>


<h3 style="color:blue">TLDR</h3>

<p>In simple words the aim of the project can be formulated as follows: to create an effective business model for the development of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles in Russia and other countries, to form a community and to make profit together.</p>

<p>Today our team is one of the best in Russia in terms of production, installation, and operation of charging stations. We have developed a whole line of our own products that implement all the main protocols, and we also have our own application. Our stations are certified by the Ministry of Industry and Trade and are installed throughout the territory of Russia. Our specialists also participate in the work of the relevant ministries as consultants.</p>

<p>Many years of experience in this industry have allowed us to develop a very clear understanding of the specifics of the charging stations market in Russia and acquire the necessary competencies for further work.</p>

<p>To realize the technical part of the project, we use a token in the TON network. </p>

<p>The token emission is tied to the installation of charging stations. Additionally, the token can be "mined" when the station connects to the Portal Network hub. Thus, the charging stations become the objects of extended functionality, performing the primary function of charging electric vehicles and the additional function of mining tokens, which organically allows for multi-level work that contributes to the development of the project as a whole.</p>

<p>All the income from the sale of electricity (general network plus mining) is distributed among liquidity holders on DEX.</p>

<p>After the project reaches a certain scale the token emission will be stopped, and its rate will start to grow continuously. This is the key factor of economic attractiveness of the project for token holders.</p>

<p>And now we will go into a little more detail.</p>

<h3>2. About electric vehicles market in Russia</h3>

<p>A few words about the state of the market, its volumes, and prospects:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The electric vehicle market, if we consider it as a whole, has several components, each of which is important and significantly affects all the processes. </li>
    <li>The first, and most obvious, is electric cars themselves. The second is the charging infrastructure for them. </li>
    <li>The third is the service sector for electric vehicles and charging stations.</li>
</ul>

<p>At the moment, we can say that the dynamics of the growth in the number of electric cars is moving from linear to exponential, and by 2030 it should gain incredible pace compared to what it has been in the recent years. </p>

<p>For example, only in March, 2023 702 new electric cars were registered– it is even more than in the whole 2020.</p>

<p>The Concept of Development of Production and Use of Electric Transport in Russia Until 2030, released by the Russian government, envisages the production of 25,000 electric cars and the launch of 9,400 charging stations by 2025, 2,900 of which are fast charging stations. And by 2030 - 10% of all the cars in Russia should be driven by electric motors. They will be able to be charged at 72,000 installed charging stations.</p>

<p>The government Concept implies 2 stages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>from 2021 to 2024 - to build 9,400 stations in Russia, of which 2,900 of which are fast charging stations,</li>
    <li> from 2025 to 2030 - 72,000 stations, 28,000 of which are fast charging stations.</li>
</ul>
<p> In addition to the 12 pilot regions, 26 more regions of Russia will be subsidized starting from 2024.</p>

<p>In other words, it is clear that the market is being formed and its potential is huge, and there is still a lot of free space on it. In today's world, this is an extremely rare situation.</p>

<h3>3. Business model of market development</h3>

<h4>3.1. Market problems</h4>
<p>Today, in addition to the state-owned companies that are building their own charging infrastructure, there are also private companies, who installs charging stations.</p>

<p>The total number of charging stations installed by all the players of the market at the beginning of 2024 is 300 pcs..</p>

<p>From the data available to us, Yandex plans to install 1,000 charging stations in 2024.</p>

<p>Private companies operate a model, similar to the state companies - they put charging stations in places that seem suitable for them, without orientation towards the end consumer.</p>

<p>Private individuals, who are in the minority, but who are already appearing, buy charging stations and put them in places where they manage to agree on technical issues and obtain a permission for installation.</p>

<p>The numbers in a national scale are negligible, which essentially says that the market has an ample room for growth. And those who start now have every chance to take a significant share of it.</p>

<p>Our competences are concentrated in one of the three components of the market, which we mentioned before, and we will talk about it now.</p>

<p>In order to be called effective, the model of entry into the charging stations market must solve the following objective problems:</p>
<ul>
    <li>the problem of the cost of technical connection (even for low power, bringing the necessary equipment to the point of installation costs on average starting from 100,000 rubles, in the case of direct current the price is already counted in millions rubles, and, as a rule, the necessary capacity is simply not available);</li>
    <li>the problem of relocation costs (if, after installation, it turns out that the location is ineffective and the charging station stands idle, moving it to another location will include the costs of dismounting and transport, as well as the costs of equipping the new location);</li>
    <li>the problem of low occupancy (it does not matter how much power you have installed and how many kilowatts it can hypothetically sell. What matters is how long the station runs. If you get one electric car a month, the station will never pay for itself);</li>
    <li>the problem of maintenance costs (charging stations are complex technical devices that must be serviced by specialists. This adds to the cost the need to maintain a staff of both customer support and on-site repairment in each city of presence);</li>
    <li>the problem of scaling (if you consider entering the market with powerful and medium powerful stations, it implies freezing huge finances until the network could be paid off).</li>
</ul>

<h4>3.2. Our concept </h4>
<p>For three years we have been testing various infrastructure development models and installing stations throughout the territory of Russia and even beyond. The data collected and competences gained have allowed us to develop a model that solves all the problems mentioned above.</p>

<p>We have developed a station model specifically for the Russian market.</p>

<p> The main advantages:</p>
<ul>
    <li>it is extremely cheap in production and maintenance in comparison with even low-power AC stations (11kW), not to mention more powerful ones, let alone DC stations;</li>
    <li>it does not require additional power supply to the installation site, as its nominal rated power (3.6kW) is available wherever there is a power grid;</li>
    <li>the station of such power also does not require additional approval, which greatly simplifies the process of negotiating the place of installation;</li>
    <li>it has the full functionality of a full-fledged charging station, i.e. it is visible in the network application, and it can proceed with electricity sales tariffication.</li>
</ul>

<p> Thus, our solution allows us to protect ourselves from financial risks associated with the high costs of technical connection and the equipment itself.</p>

<p>We certainly plan to install all types of stations, but the more powerful ones require a more careful choice of location. The basis of the charging infrastructure should start with low-power stations, which can be installed everywhere.</p>

<p>However, despite all the advantages of the equipment itself, another fundamental problem still remains – charging stations occupancy.</p>

<p>To solve this problem, we have chosen the approach of directly involving electric car owners in the process and forming a community of people interested in the development of charging infrastructure.</p>

<h4>3.3. How it all works</h4>
<p>We have developed an interactive map where electric car owners leave a location where it would be convenient for them to have a charging station, and their contact details for further verification of the point.</p>

<p>We contact people and they confirm that they really need the station in the specified location. We prepare the location and install the charging station where people will use it. In this way, we ensure that the station will be adequately used for the long term.</p>

<p>The community, apart from being a source of reliable information, is an effective management element. But  for its proper functioning, a number of tools is needed.</p>

<p>The subject of management must be understood by each community member, and everyone must be able to participate fully in all the management processes.</p>

<p>We use a token (POE) to virtually represent the network of charging stations. Its emission is tied to the charging stations itself - we issue a number of tokens equal to the costs of the station plus its installation at the current exchange rate and sell them through a decentralized exchange, or in the app to anyone interested at a fixed price and with some restrictions, which will be described at the moment of sale. </p>

<p>The token can also be “mined” using charging stations. If the owner of one or more stations wants to engage in POE token “mining”, he connects to our hub and starts exchanging data. </p>

<p>The charging station becomes a miner. The miners' income is tied to the income of the entire network. The miner receives an equivalent volume of tokens.</p>

<p>All the income from the network of charging stations is distributed in USDT among the liquidity holders on the exchange platform proportionally to their shares in the liquidity pool, at the same time the holders receive an additional profit from transactions on the exchange platform. </p>

<p>Doing useful work for the development of the project also has a value, and we reward the person who adds this value. We distinguish three types of useful work:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Community development tasks;</li>
    <li>Tool development tasks;</li>
    <li>Station network development tasks.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is quite possible, that other areas of adding value/useful work can be added in the future.</p>

<p>In addition to the financial side, a token is also considered to be a management tool. The token owner can directly participate in the development of the project. All the functionality is implemented in our Portal Network application.</p>

<h3>4. Project perspectives</h3>

<p>In a project that uses decentralized management, the existential factors are trust and security of the participants. Trust occurs where all the transactions are open to the community and there is no possibility of its tampering. This is solved by the blockchain.</p>

<p>Stations verified in our network make notes into the blockchain. Noda can be deployed by anyone in the community whose stake is at least 10,000 POE (the amount is subject to change).</p>

<p>Since profit sharing goes in crypto, we can easily scale the project to any country in the world. As a scaling tool, we have the ability to connect any stations that support the appropriate protocol and any network of stations to our network. </p>

<p>The connection procedure includes an assessment of the location and potential of the station/network by the community. In case of such connection, we set unique tariffing conditions for each operator.</p>

<p>In our nearest plans, in parallel with the development of the Russian market, we plan to enter the markets of the neighboring countries and continue with further expansion all over the planet.</p>

<p>Since the project is commercial, our main goal is to build a business that brings profit.</p>

<p>That is why we say right away that token issuance will be stopped when the system reaches a certain threshold of profitability. Our model implies a 20% profit contribution to the development and support fund, which is used to maintain the network. </p>

<p>A share of the contributions to the fund (10% by default, but the community can vote to change the size of the share) goes to the installation of new stations. And when the network revenue reaches the level that these contributions will be enough (how much "enough" will also be decided by the community) for the network to continue to grow adequately without raising additional funds by buying tokens, the POE emission will be stopped.</p>

<p>From that moment the token value and its revenue part will only grow.</p>

<p>According to our calculations, with an average station load of 6 hours per day, the profitability of the project will be more than 100%. From the point of view of classical business, the numbers are fantastic. Now in Russia there are unique economic conditions that potentially can make such things possible, but they will not last forever. That is why now we are doing our best not to miss this unique opportunity.</p>
